Welcome

Running
=======

	`cd directory-this-is-in
	python start.py`

You want it personal. Keep it in your documents (plus I don't know how to package things)

Config
======

Edit lifedrawer/config.py with relevant details.
I'll probably make a GUI editor soon!

Syncing
=======

Defaultly on git I have gitignored out the "My Drawer" folder which will probably contain mine or your personal data. You can easily configure this to your Ubuntu One/Dropbox folder or Symlink it to do so.

Please note: There is not HTML index, but all entries are HTML

TODO
====

* Hopefully get that black feel on Ubuntu instead of it looking a bit odd
* Add an App Icon
* Add some GUI configuration to the app
* Allow attachments! :D
* Go ANDROID! (for the future of course) :D
